This code sets up Kaggle and Google Colab keys in a chatbot.

To use this code, you need to have the following:
- Kaggle API key: You can obtain this key by going to your Kaggle account settings and clicking on "Create New API Token". This will download a JSON file containing your API key.
- Google Colab authentication key: You can generate this key by following the steps mentioned in the Google Colab documentation.

Once you have obtained the API key and authentication key, you can use this code to set them up in your chatbot.

Usage:
1. /key_kaggle "paste your key"
2. /key_colab "paste your key"

Note: Make sure to keep your API keys and authentication keys secure and do not share them publicly.
